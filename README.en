Hide the Sugar, Hide the Skooma
-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------


Auto-hides your skooma or sugar while trying to barter with someone who doesn't want any trouble. 
Just click on Barter again.



Alternate tweaked version:
-------------------------------------------------------------
- also lets Wise Women who barter buy moon sugar,
- also lets vendors who non-randomly sell moon sugar, skooma or paraphernalia buy either from you.
These are:
Ashumanu Eraishah at the tradehouse in Suran
Helviane Desele at Desele's House of Earthly Delights in Suran
Brathus Dals at the No Name Club in Vivec's Hlaalu Canton plaza
Rolasa Oren in the upper waistworks of Vivec's Foreign Quarter
Andilu Drothan in the Lower Waistworks in Vivec's Foreign Quarter


Alternate tweaked + MCP "Service refusal filtering" version:
-------------------------------------------------------------
- use if you have the Morrowind Code Patch installed with the "Service refusal filtering" option checked:
entirely prevents any skooma- or moon sugar- related interruptions if you try to access services besides Barter.
You won't even need to automatically hide anything if you ask to for Spells, Training, Repair, etc.
If you use this without the MCP option, any and all traders will buy skooma and sugar.



Use only one ESP,
Will conflict with anything that edits moon sugar/skooma buying restrictions,
Will not conflict with anything that edits the NPCs mentioned above
